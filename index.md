## Currently

Building enticing environments to learn coding.

### Specialized in

Godot, Python, Linux, Open Source


## Occupation

`05/2022 - 02/2023`
__self employeed__, Potsdam+Berlin

An attempt at building a leadership coaching business. Got 1 customer, but the
project turned out to be a greater success in the area of teaching programming
than coaching leadership. In some ways that might have layed the groundwork
for my current activities in game development and volunteer teaching, which
are both pretty fulfilling and feel more in alignment with my purpose and
skills.

`05/2021 - 05/2022`
__In search of self__, Heidelberg+Potsdam

In this time I did a lot of different trainings, workshops, online courses and
art projects and grew my foundation beyond my developer experience in business,
coaching, agile, art and even acting domains.

`06/2020 - 04/2021`
__Senior Software Engineer__, Walldorf

As part of a diverse team of Red Hat (my employer), SAP, and IBM people, we
integrated a new virtual machine technology (kubevirt) into our existing
Kubernetes (Openshift) tech stacks.

`06/2019 - 05/2020`
__Senior Openshift Consultant__, Munich, Remote

I went to customers and helped plan and install Openshift (the Red Hat
Kubernetes) environments.

`03/2017 - 05/2019`
__Software Engineer__, Walldorf

Coming in as Python tooling developer, I quickly adopted to the new trend
and worked with my team to integrate our distributed database landscape into
the growing Kubernetes world.

`2007 - 2016`
__Working Student__, Berlin+Wildau

Various smaller roles as software engineer.

### Research interests
